The 20-20-20 rule is an [optometrist-recommended](https://opto.ca/health-library/the-20-20-20-rule) rule to help prevent digital eye strain: every 20 minutes of looking at a screen, take a 20 second break and look at something at least 20 feet away. It's harder for your eyes to focus on something close to you, so periodically looking further away gives them a much needed rest.
