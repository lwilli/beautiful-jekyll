I happened to stumble upon this interesting glitch (feature?) in MacOS Sierra that makes your window shrink down to a cute little toy version that is almost completely unusable. Check it out:

At the end, the tiny little rectangle that appears in the bottom/center is the shrunken version of the window I initially minimized. Interestingly, it's still possible to interact with the window, though it doesn't exactly behave like its normal-sized self.

Try it for yourself! (just make sure you don't do this with a window you care about):
1. Choose any open program and minimize it (`command+m`).
2. `command+tab` until the program is selected (specifically, `command+tab`, hold `command` and let go of `tab`, `command+shift+tab`).
3. Then while still holding down `command`, press the `down arrow` (you can now let go of `command`). This will show you the open and minimized windows of the current application.
5. `Arrow down` to one of the minimized windows (so that itâ€™s highlighted).
6. Then press the `spacebar` to preview it.
7. Press the `spacebar` again to close the preview.
8. Press `esc` to go back to the normal desktop.
9. Now go to your dock and click the program/window you just did this too and it should pop back out as a super tiny version.
