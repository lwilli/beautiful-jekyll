Hello! My name is Logan Williams and I like to make things.

I am a Christ-follower and I believe the Bible to be truth and try to live by it. Most importantly, that Jesus died for our forgiveness and invites us in to become children of God!

I am the husband to the lovely woman over at [WelcomeToTheWilliams.com](https://www.welcometothewilliams.com) and a proud father.

I enjoy tinkering and making things, including (but not limited to!) software, food, gardens, and music.
