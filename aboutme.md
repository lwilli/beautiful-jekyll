Hello! My name is Logan Williams and I like to make things.

I call myself a Christ-follower because I believe the Bible to be truth and try to live by it. Most importantly, that Jesus died for our forgiveness!

I am a husband to the lovely woman over at [WelcomeToTheWilliams.com](https://www.welcometothewilliams.com).

I enjoy tinkering and making things, including (but not limited to!) software, food, vehicles, and music.
